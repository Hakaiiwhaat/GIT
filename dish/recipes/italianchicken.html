        <p>This Italian dressing chicken marinade is a super simple but delicious way to add flavor before grilling.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>Procedures:</h1>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
            Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
